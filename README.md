**Project Overview:**

This application implements a highly advanced AI agent that progressively learns your Rock Paper Scissors playing patterns to provide an increasingly challenging gameplay experience. The AI combines multiple prediction strategies and features a clean, intuitive graphical interface with real-time visualization of the AI's prediction probabilities.

**Key Features:**
**Advanced AI Implementation**

Deep Learning: LSTM neural network to recognize complex temporal patterns in player behavior
Reinforcement Learning: Q-learning with experience replay for optimizing decision-making
Markov Chain Modeling: First, second, and third-order Markov chains for sequential prediction
Psychological Modeling: Integration of known human RPS psychology and game theory
Meta-Learning: Dynamic strategy selection based on performance metrics
Ensemble Method: Weighted voting system that combines predictions from all strategies

**Rich Graphical Interface:**
Clean, modern UI built with Tkinter
Real-time probability visualization showing what the AI thinks you'll play next
Comprehensive game history tracking
Detailed statistics and performance visualizations
Save/load functionality to preserve AI learning progress

**Analytics and Insights:**
Pattern analysis that reveals your playing tendencies
Performance visualizations showing win rates and strategy effectiveness
Detailed breakdowns of gameplay statistics
AI commentary on observed player patterns

**Technologies Used**
Python
PyTorch (neural networks)
NumPy (statistical modeling)
Matplotlib (data visualization)
Tkinter (GUI)
Threading (responsive UI)
Learning Capabilities
The AI starts with basic strategies and gradually becomes more sophisticated as it:
Builds statistical models of your play patterns
Identifies context-specific behaviors (e.g., what you play after winning)
Recognizes repeating sequences and patterns
Dynamically adjusts strategy weights based on success rates
Reduces exploration in favor of exploitation as it gains confidence
Implementation Details
The system combines traditional statistical methods with modern deep learning approaches to create a hybrid AI that can both recognize patterns and adapt to changing strategies. The reinforcement learning component allows the AI to continuously improve through gameplay experience, while the real-time visualization gives players insight into how the AI "thinks."
This project demonstrates advanced AI concepts, machine learning techniques, and GUI development in a fun, interactive game format.
